LU-19784 tests: mmp/test_8 wait time changes

To prepare for the e2fsprogs/libext2fs changes
reducing the wait time when the MMP sequence
number is EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN,

LU-19784 ext2fs: mmp wait time ajustments
https://review.whamcloud.com/63478

We need to make sure the sequence number is not
EXT4_MMP_SEQ_CLEAN before running e2fsck.

We can use debugfs to change the MMP sequence number,
rename mark_mmp_block() to set_mmp_seq() to reflect
this.

Remove mmp_mark.sh, which is not needed any more.
