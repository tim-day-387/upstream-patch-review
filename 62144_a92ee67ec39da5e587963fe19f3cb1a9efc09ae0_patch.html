LU-19537 quota: fix race of lqe_glbl_lgd and qmt_sarr

When the "qmt_sarr" is updated by processing the new connection
from the QSD, the "lqe_glbl_data" allocated in qmt_lvbo_init
could still use the old slv_nr of the "qmt_sarr", which could
cause the slv_nr is less than the value stored in "qmt_sarr" when
qmt_seed_glbe_all is called and causes the ASSERTION.
