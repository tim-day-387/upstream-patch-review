LU-19779 ofd: add warn to enable near-full OST utilization

Add a warning message on ENOSPC in the OFD write path that logs
the OST object FID and its parent FID. This improves attribution
and observability when ENOSPC occurs, allowing administrators to
identify impacted files and respond more confidently as OSTs
approach full capacity.
