LU-12668 ec: Add lfs mirror verify support for ec comps

This adds support for lfs mirror verify for ec
components.
It reuses mostly the same code as the existing resync
since the operations are mostly the same except for
"writing the computed parities" vs "comparing the
computed parities to the ones on disc".
