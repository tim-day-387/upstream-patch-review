LU-6497 llite: Remove redundant check

Remove redundant check for 'result' under ll_page_mkwrite0()

'return' stores the return value cl_io_loop(). Which indicates
that IO was successfully submitted. The two checks following
cl_io_loop() are to confirm if the pages are in consistent state
or not. That is, a) page is not truncated b) Page is still dirty.
In these case, the result is appropriately set to either -ENODATA
or -EAGAIN.

It looks like the addition result check is not required as when
checking for !PageDirty(vmpage) 'result' is just marked -EAGAIN
without checking for result == 0. The same pattern is followed
under vmpage->mapping == NULL check removing the redundant result
check
