LU-12668 ec: Add tests for computing the parity coverage

When we write or verify the parities we no longer
use the whole stripe, instead we compute the coverage
of what ranges of parity is important and what can be
ignored.
This is based on SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE and EOF.

Add tests that we compute these ranges correctly.
