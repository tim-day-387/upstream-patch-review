LU-19365 tests: use nidmask in 72e for ipv6 support

Use nidmask for nodemap ranges as they are IPV6 friendly. This
test was failing for IPv6 case and this change will use nidmask
which will allow us to use more ipv6 nids in range.

Test-Parameters: trivial testlist=sanity-sec env=ONLY=72e env=FORCE_LARGE_NID=true,LOAD_MODULES_REMOTE=true
