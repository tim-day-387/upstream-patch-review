LU-19698 tcu: add option to use parent UID to name in Trash Can

The design principle of UID Trash Can type is to have files with
the same UID located in the corresponding UID naming directory in
Trash Can together. This makes TCU easier to mange and can enhance
the objective and speed of scanning.

However, when the UIDs between the parent directory and child file
are different, it makes the child and parent are in different UID
naming directory in Trash Can.
When access Trash Can files via ".Trash", we use UID of the
current parent directory to locate files. This causes it cannot
find the files moving into Trash Can but in the different UID
naming directory.

To solve this problem, we add an option to use parent UID to name
files moving into Trash Can instead of its own UID:
	lctl set_param mdd.*.trash_can_puid=1

This mechanism ensures that the namespace in Trash Can are not
discretized due to UIDs' difference, but the design principle of
UID Trash Can type, that files with the same UID located in the
corresponding UID naming directory together, may be broken.

Add test case sanityn/118j.
