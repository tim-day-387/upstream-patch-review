LU-19598 utils: implement ltrash_purge tool

This patch implements ltrash_purge daemon based on pfind to
automatically clean up files from Lustre Trash Can based on
configurable policies.
It has the following features:
 - multiple purging policies:
   - space-based policy for mdt and ost (default: 90%)
   - age-based policy (default: 30 days)
   - user-based policy (UID/GID/PROJID)
 - different operational modes:
   - daemon mode: continuous monitoring with scan intervals
      (default: 60s)
   - dry-run mode: scan and report without deleting files
   - empty mode: purge all files from Trash Can regardless of
      filters
 - performance optimizations:
   - efficient traversal using new defined llapi_find_with_cb()
     based on pfind framework to support custom callbacks
   - parallel scanning and purging (default: 4 threads)
   - usage checks every N deletions to avoid excessive overhead
 - statistics and monitoring:
   - statistics tracking (scanned/purged objects, freed bytes)
   - yaml-formatted stat dump on SIGUSR1 signal
   - configurable dump file location
 - configuration:
   - conf file at /etc/ltrash_purge.conf by default
   - command line
 - signal handling: siguser1, sigint, sigterm

The following tests are added to sanityn.sh to verify this patch:
   - test_119a: verify dry-run and empty modes
   - test_119b: test space-based purging
   - test_119c: test age-based purging
