LU-19545 ec: tight binding parity mirror to data mirror

Parity mirrors need to be tightly coupled to the specific data mirror
they were created to match, so that we can find the data mirror
corresponding to the parity mirror.

To accomplish this, we stores the mirror ID of the data mirror in each
of the corresponding parity components and vice versa.

Added llapi_layout_test tests 62 and 63.
