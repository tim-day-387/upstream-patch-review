LU-18562 tests: fix sanity-dom/150ib/ic for extent MDT

The MDT ldiskfs formatting options were changed to use extents
by default, in order to improve llog allocation performance.
This caused sanity-dom sanity test_150ib and test_150ic to fail,
because they expected indirect block allocation for DoM files.

Fix these subtests to allow either indirect or extent mapped block
allocation, since the exact number of blocks is not critical, but
rather that fallocate preallocates at least the blocks requested.

Improve sanity test_131b error messages, since I saw that subtest
fail occasionally (though for unrelated reasons), and having two
identical error messages makes it harder to debug than necessary.
