LU-17240 tests: add parallel format/mount/unmount support

Add support for parallel format, mount, and unmount operations
in the test framework. These operations are controlled by a
hierarchy of variables that allow fine-grained control over
which operations run in parallel, which target types are
parallelized, and whether different target types can overlap.

Variable hierarchy:
- PARALLEL_OPS: Master switch controlling all operations
- PARALLEL_FORMAT, PARALLEL_MOUNT, PARALLEL_UMOUNT: Enable
  parallelism for specific operations (default to PARALLEL_OPS)
- PARALLEL_FORMAT_TARGETS, PARALLEL_MOUNT_TARGETS,
  PARALLEL_UMOUNT_TARGETS: Space-separated list of target types
  to parallelize within each operation (e.g., "mdt ost")
- PARALLEL_FORMAT_TYPES, PARALLEL_MOUNT_TYPES,
  PARALLEL_UMOUNT_TYPES: Whether to overlap different target
  types during operations (inter-type parallelism)

Implementation:
- New helper function parallel_enabled_for(operation, target_type)
  checks if parallelism is enabled for a specific combination
- Updated formatall(), mountmds(), mountoss(), stopall(),
  unmountoss() to support parallel execution with proper wait
  barriers between target types when overlap is disabled
- MGS excluded from parallel operations since there's only
  ever one MGS target

All parallel operations are disabled by default (PARALLEL_OPS=0)
for backward compatibility. Future patches will enable these
features gradually after validation.

Test results show significant performance improvements when enabled:
- Parallel format with type overlap: 19% faster than baseline
- Parallel mount within types: 7% faster
- Parallel unmount within types: 21% faster
