LU-19692 mgc: notify MGS about target NIDs after reconnect

After MGS failover its NID tables should be rebuilt from
targets like it is done during initial target registration

For that the upcall is registered in MGC and called in
mgc_notify_active(), it collects local NIDs data and calls
call tgt_nids_notify() to let MGS build NID tables for IR

The mgc_nid_nofity() is changed to handle bulk too,
because amount of NIDs can be big

conf-sanity.sh test 73e is modified with extra test case

test_77k sanity.sh was updated to don't race at mount time
