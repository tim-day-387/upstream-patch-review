LU-19822 lnet: interfaces can be manually disabled

Implement lnetctl disable/enable to allow admins to selectively
block traffic on LNet interfaces. Currently, the only way to
manually disable an LNet interface is to delete it. An lnetctl
tunable would give admins a network agnostic method to
temporarily block traffic to a subset of clients or block
certain routes.

This patch also implements the needed kernel infrastructure. When
an interface is disabled, sends are routed over the other available
interfaces (if available). recv are dropped outright.
