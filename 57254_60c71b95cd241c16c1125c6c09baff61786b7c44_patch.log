LU-17902 nrs: add NRS TBF policy for nodemap

For isolation of workloads across multiple sub-tenants of a FS,
it would be useful to allow registering a NRS TBF rule for a
nodemap, so it is easy to set resource constraints directly per
tenant instead of having to specify NIDs or UIDs (which are only
indirectly related to the nodemap/tenant and may become stale).

And add a test case sanityn/test_77ke to verify it works as expected.
