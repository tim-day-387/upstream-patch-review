LU-19447 fld: fix an error handling in fld_client_rpc()

In fld_client_rpc(), when the first rpc returns -EAGAIN, it will
sleep for 2 seconds and then retry, and will quit retrying when an
interrupt is received. However, it has already put the first req
before the sleep, and after the interrupt, it will try to put the req
again, which leads to a double free.
