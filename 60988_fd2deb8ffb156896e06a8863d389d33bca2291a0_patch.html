LU-18687 lnet: move debug to LNet

Lustre debugging code will find a new home in LNet.
This code belongs to the LNet and Lustre drivers.
Since placing this in upstream lib/ is unlikely to
be accepted, we place it in LNet. Drivers (like Lustre
or LNet Selftest) that stack on-top of LNet can opt to
use these features as well.
