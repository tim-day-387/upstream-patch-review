LU-8585 tests: re-enable fid2path sanity test for subdir mount

When a subdirectory is mounted, the .lustre directory cannot be
seen. With the move of llapi_fid2path() from using .lustre/fid to
name_to_handle_at() previous sanity test that failed due to
file sets being enabled should now pass since name_to_handle_at()
should be file set aware. We update a few test applications to
work with llapi_open_by_fid() if we can't access .lustre. Same
is done with liblustreapi.so as well.

Fixes: f71554200 ("LU-11208 tests: add version check to sanity tests")
Fixes: e2ac6e1ea ("LU-9341 lod: Add special O_APPEND striping")
Fixes: 9bd3e64b8 ("LU-28 fileset: add fileset mount support")
Test-Parameters: trivial envdefinitions=FILESET=/subdir testlist=sanity
