LU-12187 llapi: create arbitrary mirror IDs and validate count

Currently, the component list on the llapi has no concept of mirrors,
and the mirror count is explicitly set through
"llapi_layout_mirror_count_set()". However, there is no validation
during layout sanity check that the set mirror count matches the
component layout. In case an incorrect mirror count is set this then
fails at the LOD layer on the MDS.

This patch includes the following:
1. Adds validation for composite layouts during the sanity check if
   the mirror count matches the component layout.
2. Adds the function "llapi_layout_mirror_count_sync()" which sets the
   mirror count based on the component layout.
3. During the new function in 2., assign a temporary mirror ID for
   each component. This is used on a follow-up patch to address a
   component with a mirror ID to protect with EC.

Added llapi_layout_tests 36 and 37 to exercise this functionality.
