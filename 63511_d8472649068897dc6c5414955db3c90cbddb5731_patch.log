LU-19809 utils: Fixes lfs migrate to return correct exit code

The `lfs migrate` command does not propagate the
correct exit code when `cb_migrate_mdt_fini()` fails.
This patch ensures that the command returns a proper
non-zero exit status in such cases, allowing scripts
and automation to detect failures reliably.
