LU-19079 nodemap: add flag to identify clients with gss

Add new nodemap property gssonly_identification.
If set to 1, clients for this nodemap are no longer identified based
on their NIDs, but instead by the GSS token they are using to
authenticate. Consequently, a nodemap with this property set cannot
have any NID ranges defined. Any client using the GSS token associated
with this nodemap to authenticate is considered part of this nodemap.
