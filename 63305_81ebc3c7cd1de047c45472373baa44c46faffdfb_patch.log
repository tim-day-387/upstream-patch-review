LU-19237 llite: Update i_version when losing osc/dom lock

It looks like when multiple nodes reexport NFS, writes via one server
might not be visible on the other one.
Similarly to readdir cache, looks like we need to update i_version
when we lose osc/dom lock as a proxy for some other node doing writes.

There's no easy way to see the inode at OSC layer, but every time we
lose a lock CAT_KMS att update is set so we'd latch onto that.
Potentially some writes might also call that, but we do not want to
remove regular VFS i_version handling for writes anyway because not
every write extends the KMS.
