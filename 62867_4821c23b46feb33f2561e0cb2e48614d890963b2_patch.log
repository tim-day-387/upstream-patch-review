LU-19242 obd: make ldlm_enqueue_min in sync with at_min/max

ldlm_enqueue_min tuning is similar to at_min/at_max, so make it
available the same way: move it to lustre.ldlm_enqueue_min (it was
recently introduced in LU-18878 as lustre.ldlm.ldlm_enqueue_min);
and add per-obd tunings as well.

replay-single test_68 uses the module's ldlm_enqueue_min parameter.
It must not be mixed with the ldlm_enqueue_min ldlm tunable.
