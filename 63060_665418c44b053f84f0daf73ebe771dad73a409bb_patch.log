LU-19709 osc: fix LASSERT failure on osc_extent_find()

The customer hits the following LBUG on a client:
(osc_cache.c:735:osc_extent_find()) ASSERTION( *grants >=
chunksize + cli->cl_grant_extent_tax ) failed: 0/4096/24576.

The reason is that an OES_ACTIVE extent being used by a writer
may be written back and changed into the other state at any
time.
If the original extent (@ext) comes from @osc_extent_expand(),
the value of @grants will be set with 0.
This may result in the panic at the above assertion when try to
restart finding a new extent in @osc_extent_find().

The patch resets @tmp value and @grants value by calling
@osc_enter_cache() and compensate the accounted grant, fixing the
panic accrodingly.
