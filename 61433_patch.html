LU-15928 osd: pass keylen to dt_lookup and dt_lookup_dir

This is the first of the series to pass length of the key to
DT index API, changing only dt_lookup() and dt_lookup_dir().

With fscrypt passing binary names to the underlying ldiskfs storage,
this make sure keys with embedded NUL bytes gets processed properly.
