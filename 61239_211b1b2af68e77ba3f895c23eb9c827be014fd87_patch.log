LU-18222 quota: add LQA directory-based record management

Add directory-based LQA initialization at MDT startup that scans for
lqa-dt-* and lqa-md-* directories in quota_master and automatically
creates in-memory LQA structures with ranges.

LQA range record format uses struct lqa_id_range from lustre_user.h

lir_start: Range start ID (inclusive)
lir_end: Range end ID (inclusive)

This structure defines the record format used to store LQA ranges
in indexed storage. Each range is stored as a separate IAM record with
the range start ID as the key and this structure as the record value.

Range indexes are stored as "ranges" IAM index in the pool directory:
quota_master/
  ├── lqa-dt-<lqa_name>/   # Data target pool for <lqa_name>
  │   └── ranges           # Binary file containing DT ranges
  └── lqa-md-<lqa_name>/   # Metadata target pool for <lqa_name>
       └── ranges           # Binary file containing MD ranges
