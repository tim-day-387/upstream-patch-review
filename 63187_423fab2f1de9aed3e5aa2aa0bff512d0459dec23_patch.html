LU-17240 tests: enable parallel formatting by default

Enable parallel formatting of targets by default. This includes
both intra-type parallelism (multiple MDTs or OSTs formatted
simultaneously) and inter-type parallelism (MDT and OST formatting
overlapping).

Configuration:
- PARALLEL_FORMAT now defaults to 1 (enabled)
- PARALLEL_FORMAT_TYPES inherits from PARALLEL_FORMAT (=1)
- PARALLEL_FORMAT_TARGETS="mdt ost" (MGS excluded)
- Other operations (mount, unmount) remain disabled

Test environment:
- 1 MGS (combined with MDS)
- 1 MDT (245MB)
- 2 OSTs (391MB each)

Performance results:
- Baseline (serial formatting): 31.1s
- Parallel formatting: 17.3-25.7s
- Improvement: 17-44% faster
