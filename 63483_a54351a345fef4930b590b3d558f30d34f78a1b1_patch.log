LU-19793 tcu: create a virtual MOUNT/.ltrash for subdir mount

Create a virtual dir "MOUNT/.ltrash" which is a shortcut (or a
link) to the FID LU_TRASH_FID for normal Lustre mount or subdir
mount.
By this way, the userspace tool such as ltrash_purge is able to
access files in Trash Can for both normal Lustre mount or a given
subdir mount uniformly.
Also we can use open by fid of LU_TRASH_FID to access the Trash,
but the purge operations cannot be parallelized because it can
only accessed through the file handle (fd) level by level in DFS
order.
This patch makes the access for Trash via file path uniformly and
also support parallel operations with multiple threads.

This patch also renames ".lustre/trash" with ".lustre/.ltrash".
Add sanityn/test_118m.
