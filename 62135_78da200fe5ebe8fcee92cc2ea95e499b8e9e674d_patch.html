LU-12668 ec: add support to resync stale ec comps

Add support for syncing stale EC mirrors.
This is done by the command:
  lfs mirror resync ...
just like resyncing ordinary mirrors.

If an extent has both stale ordinary mirrors and also
stale ec mirrors the ordinary mirrors will be synced
first and the ec mirorrs afterwards.

Document the stripe layout and the relation between
stripe offsets in the data comp and the asosciated
parity stripes in the ec comp.
