LU-19264 ldlm: improve server notify clients to reclaim locks

This patch introduces three improvements to the LDLM lock reclaim
mechanism:

1. Use ptlrpc_set to manage all asynchronous notify requests sent
   to clients, and wait for all of them to complete before exiting
   the server-side lock reclaim process.

2. Introduce LDLM_SET_INFO to define the data structure used to
   notify clients with information such as:
     - lock server memory pressure estimation
     - total number of locks maintained by the server
     - number of locks to be reclaimed
   This allows clients to make more informed decisions when
   revoking locks.

3. Add a sysfs tunable for the LDLM reclaim policy. The new file
   `ldlm_reclaim_pol` under sysfs allows setting the lock reclaim
   policy dynamically.
