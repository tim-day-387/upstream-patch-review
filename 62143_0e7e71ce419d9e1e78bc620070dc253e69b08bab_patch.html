LU-19552 llite: convert OBF filename to FID

Convert open-by-fid filename to FID in LLITE, this can save roundtrip
to MDT0 to locate target MDT for the FID if the object pointed by the
FID is not located on MDT0.

Since for OBF the name hash is not packed, add a new flag MDS_NAMEHASH
to indicate the name hash is packed, and the existing flag MDS_OP_FID
to indicate this is an op-by-FID.
