LU-930 gnilnd: fix whitespace and style issues

Fix basic code style issues with the gnilnd code:
- explicit values in UAPI enums to avoid bugs if added/removed
- fix comment style to avoid triggering space-intent checks
- use tabs instead of spaces for declaration alignment
- wrap comment lines at 80 columns in nearby code

There are still many more style issues in the function declaration
blocks (lines over 80 chars, spaces for alignment), and many other
checkpatch warnings, but too many to fix in this patch.
