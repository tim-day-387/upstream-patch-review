LU-18818 utils: covert to libext2fs for rest of ldiskfs ops

Now all ldiskfs operations are converted to libext2fs
except .make_lustre. One downside is if the filesystem
is not clean when modification is needed like ldiskfs_rename,
we do not replay the journal and e2fsck is required.

We now require e2fsprogs 1.47.3-wc2 to build, which includes
the quota headers for libext2fs.

Rename toqb to stoqb, to avoid symbol conflict with libext2fs,
and align with upstream name.

ldiskfs_label_lustre and ldiskfs_label_read now tries to use
ioctl FS_IOC_{GET|SET}FSLABEL, if that fails fall back to
the old method.

Allow FS_IOC_{GET|SET}FSLABEL to passthrough for the newer
kernels e.g. rhel9.

Make sure the mdt image from disk2_7-ldiskfs.tar.bz2 is in clean
state.
