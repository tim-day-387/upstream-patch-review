LU-19597 tbf: remove the redundant codes

This patch removes specific TBF policies ("struct nrs_tbf_ops"
callbacks) and associated hashtables, retaining only the generic
policy functions.

The policy hashtables are unified into a single rhashtable to use RCU
accesses. The hash key is built by packing the enabled TBF fields.

e.g: "tbf uid+gid" policy has a hash key length of 64bits (2*32bits).

This patch reworks the TBF LRU to make it generic, replacing the
previous implementation that relied on cfs_hash buckets.
It uses RCU list/lock to reduce the contention.

The TBF_CLI_DEBUG macro has been introduced to provide detailed
information about object classes. It uses the rule format to display
the hash key.

e.g:
nrs_tbf_lru_tryhit()) mdt.0 NRS: TBF LRU hit: class@...
jobid={touch.0}&uid={0}&gid={0} rule@...

Add regression test sanityn 77s.
