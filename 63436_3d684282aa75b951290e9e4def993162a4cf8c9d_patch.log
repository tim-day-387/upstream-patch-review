LU-19798 osp: fix osp_md_index_it_next() on retry

In osp_md_index_it_next() if 'ent' is non-NULL and points to the
last entry in the current index page. In this case, a new index
page will be loaded with osp_it_next_page() and after the loading,
'ent' remains intact. The entry retrieving based on 'ent' is wrong.
Even worse, it may cause kernel crash by accessing an unmaped page.

Only instantiate 'ent' after the again: marker so that it points
to the correct page even if there are retries in this function.

Fix nearby code style issues (no 'else' after 'return', formatting).
