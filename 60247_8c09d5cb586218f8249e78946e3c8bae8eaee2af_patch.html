LU-18222 quota: add lctl lqa commands

Deploy lctl lqa management commands: lqa new, lqa add, lqa remove,
lqa list and lqa destroy. These commands must be called only on the
MDT0000. Add a new IOCTL to process lqa commands at the QMT. There is
no actual support of LQA yet - QMT only parses lqa arguments. LQA
handlers will be added to the QMT in the next patches.
