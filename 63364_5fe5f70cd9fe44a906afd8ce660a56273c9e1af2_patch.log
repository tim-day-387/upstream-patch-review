LU-11509 ldlm: fix lfru priv_ratio_limit overflow issue

Change the type of ns_lfru_priv_ratio_limit_256 from __s8 to __u8
to prevent potential overflow issues during ratio calculations.

Additionally, enforce a valid range for priv_ratio_limit between
10% and 70%. This ensures the LFRU privileged pool maintains a
reasonable size relative to the total cache.
