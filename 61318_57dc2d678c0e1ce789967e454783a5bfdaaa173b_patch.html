LU-17231 doc: updated man page script

Updated the generate-manpage.sh script to generate better parameter
man pages.

Now uses --param to create a parameter man page, and they are no
longer headed by lctl-param as it could be confused with
lctl-{get,list,set}_param, and also makes looking for parameters
easier.

Added lctl help_param to open the man file for a parameter which
includes tab completion for intermediate directories to make it
easier to find groups of parameter man pages.

The man pages cpu_partition_table(4) and cpu_partition_distance(4)
have been added as an example for formatting.
