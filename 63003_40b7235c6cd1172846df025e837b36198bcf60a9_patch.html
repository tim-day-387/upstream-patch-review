LU-19693 efalnd: Fix object pools double destroy on create fail

If we fail creating an object  pool on device init, we call the destroy
pool handler to cleanup any allocated object that succeeded prior to the
failure. After cleanup completed we call dev destroy which again calls
the destroy pool handler which tries to use already freed memory. Fix
this by setting the object array to NULL.
