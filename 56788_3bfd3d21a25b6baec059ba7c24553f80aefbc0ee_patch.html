LU-16897 lnet: sparse read optimization (SRO)

When a sparse file is read, pages representing holes are built with
zeroes and sent. Sparse read optimization (SRO) will prevent sending
zeroes through network.

When an OSS wants to send an LNet message containing pages coming from
holes, md is remapped to skip holes and an LNET_MSG_PUT_SPARSE is sent
to share the new mapping with hole locations. When the client receives
this message, it does the remapping and ACK. Then, the server will
send the remapped data as usual.

SRO works at ptlrpc and LNet level, leaving lnd code untouched. It
requires the patch on the client and the OSSs. If the OSS or the
client does not have the patch, SRO will simply be disabled.

SRO is configured per client (one value for each OST):
$ lctl set_param osc.*.sparse_read_threshold_kb=<uint>
If the value is 0, SRO is simply disabled. If the value is greater, it
defines the threshold for the minimum number of sparse pages needed
(on the client) in an LNet message to have the optimization enabled.
The value in kiB is rounded up to correspond to a multiple of
PAGE_SIZE. Indeed, since SRO increases the number of messages shared
between the OSS and the client, it won't be always productive. Thus,
the threshold can be tuned depending on the environment.
