LU-19620 obdclass: llog to continue if broken

if a plain llog is corrupted for a reason, then llog_osd_next_block()
return -EINVAL. handle this error in llog_process_thread() so that
llog processing doesn't stop.

a catalog can be corrupted as well and we should be able to recover.

add a procfs entry dumping current plain llog used by OSP:
osp..sync_current_llog=[0x1:0x5:0x0] (1 plains), current [0x1:0x6:0x0]

add a test reproducing a broken llog problems.
