LU-16499 lfs: merge lfs_migrate auto-stripe into 'lfs migrate'

This integrates the auto-striping functionality from the lfs_migrate
script into the lfs migrate command, providing users with a unified
interface for file migration with automatic stripe count calculation.

The options from lfs_migrate that are now available in lfs migrate:

- -A, --auto-stripe: Automatically determine stripe count using the
  algorithm stripe_count = sqrt(size_in_GB) + 1
- -K, --auto-cap CAP: Limit migrated file to use at most 1/CAP of
  available space on each OST (default: 100, i.e., 1% of OST space)
- -M, --min-free MIN_FREE: Minimum free space (in KB) required on an
  OST for it to be considered available for migration (default: 256MB)
- -X, --max-free MAX_FREE: Maximum free space (in KB) that can be
  considered available for migration on each OST

Also updated all relevant occurrences of lfs_migrate to use the
lfs migrate command instead.

Test-Parameters: trivial
