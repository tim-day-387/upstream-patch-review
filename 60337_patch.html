LU-19204 hsm: support cancel requests for lhsmtool_posix

This patch adds the support of HSM cancel request (HSMA_CANCEL) for
lhsmtool_posix copytool.

The purpose of this patch is to test HSM cancels sent to an copytool.

Thread are registered into a binary tree (the FID is used as key).
When a cancel is received, the running thread is notified that it
should stop. The running thread checks the cancel condition in the
IO loop.
