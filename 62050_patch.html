LU-12668 ec: Add a function to compute chunk layout of k in ec

When creating a k,m ec comp the total number of stripes in the data
comp we are protecting may not be evenly divisible with k.
This adds a function that will split 'total' into a set of smaller
chunks of size 'k', or smaller.
The aim is to create as few chunks as possible to map all the stripes in
'total' but also maintain as small as possible difference between the
largest and smallest resulting chunk sizes.

This implementation will split the total into at most two different
sizes, k0 and k1, where k0 and k1 only differ by 1.

Examples:
Splitting 19 by 7 results in 1 x (k0 == 7) + 2 * (k1 == 6) chunks
Splitting 17 by 7 results in 2 x (k0 == 6) + 1 x (k1 == 5)
Splitting 15 by 7 results in 3 x (k == 5) (pathological case)
