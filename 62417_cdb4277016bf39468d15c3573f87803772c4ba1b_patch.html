LU-12668 ec: basic ec tests

This test requires 8 OSTs.

Number of parity stripes used can not exceed the number of stripes
in the data mirror or else the parity data will not fit in the extent.
Add tests that we can not create ec mirrors that violate this.

Add test that resyncing computes the parities correctly.

Add test that the "parity" of a single stripe data component
is just a copy of the data.

Add test that we set the stripe size for the ec component to match
the stripe size for the data component.
