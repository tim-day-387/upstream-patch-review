LU-18192 nrs: cleanup jobid/opcode/uid/gid NRS TBF types

Cleanup the redundant codes about the separate TBF types:
jobid|opcode|uid|gid.

They can all repace with the generic TBF type.
Please note we can not cleanup NID TBF type right now until the
generic TBF type fully replaces @cfs_hash with @rhashtable.
