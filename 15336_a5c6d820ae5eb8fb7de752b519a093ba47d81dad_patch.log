LU-4215 out: few optimization to the protocol

OUT packing format is used in ZIL support and it's very space
consuming in few cases: struct obdo (208bytes) to transfer
attributes, EA's names. it's possible to optimize those:
 - struct obdo can be replaced with varsize array
 - frequest EA's names can be encoded with a single byte
this helps to reduce I/O overhead for ZIL significantly.
also, this will help to improve LFSCK, MDT-to-OST synchronization
performance
