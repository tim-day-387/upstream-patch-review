LU-19744 doc: bulk man page review

Bulk review done by Augment and Claude Code.

Completed systematic review and update of lfs command man
pages (Section 1 and 8), adding missing options, fixing
formatting issues, and creating missing man pages.

New man pages added:
- lfs-data_version.1: document lfs data_version command
- lfs-swap_layouts.1: document lfs swap_layouts command
- lfs-unlink_foreign.1: document lfs unlink_foreign command

Major updates to existing pages:
- lfs.1: updated for completeness, added missing commands
- lfs-find.1: fixed TH line syntax
- lfs-getdirstripe.1: documented missing options
- lfs-getsom.1: documented missing --help option
- lfs-heat_get.1: fixed man page formatting and content
- lfs-hsm.1: documented missing lfs-hsm options
- lfs-migrate.1: added --mdt-overcount, --fid, --lustre-dir
- lfs-pcc.1: added --readonly and --write options
- lfs_migrate.1: updated for completeness
- lfs-rm_entry.8: updates and corrections

Other improvements:
- Fixed formatting and syntax issues throughout
- Improved consistency across man pages
- Added missing option documentation
- Fixed typos and unclear descriptions

This is part of a bulk review of Lustre man pages for
minor issues using LLM coding agents. The review found
many small issues in the man pages. Not every single
change was reviewed in detail - larger changes were
reviewed, but minor consistency fixes were not verified
individually. While the LLMs made some mistakes, the net
result should be a significant improvement over the
current state.
