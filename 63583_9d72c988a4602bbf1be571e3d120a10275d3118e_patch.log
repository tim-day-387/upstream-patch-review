LU-19828 kfilnd: Map intf to cxi device kfi config

Introduce lustre_lnet_kfi_intf2cxi() to perform a lookup of the cxi
device based on the provided interface name. This is called by
lustre_lnet_kfi_intf2nid() to resolve the interface names in the
YAML configuration path, as well as by jt_add_ni()/jt_del_ni() to
resolve names on the lnetctl net add/del path.

This allows administrators to specify regular Linux network device
names when configuring kfi networks.
