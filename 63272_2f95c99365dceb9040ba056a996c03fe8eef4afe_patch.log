LU-19750 mdt: update mdt_changelog_allow() version check

Update MDT llog version check to allow clients to access llog
until client-side fix to initialize mdt_body is widely available.
Add OBD_CONNECT_LLOG_UCRED flag to notify the MDS that the client
_should_ have sent mdt_body, and a missing mdt_body is an error.

The OBD_CONNECT_LLOG_UCRED flag is re-using OBD_CONNECT_LOV_V3,
unused since it was first added in 1.6.0-1808-g665e36b780.
