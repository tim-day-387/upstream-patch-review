LU-19478 nodemap: clear dyn nodemaps when config is changed

When persistent nodemaps are modified, synchronization to other server
targets replaces the nodemap config. As a result, all dynamic nodemaps
are removed as well, which is indended.

However, when the MGS is co-located with another server target like
MDS or OSS, the dynamic nodemaps are not cleared on the MGS node and
only on the remote server targets. This results in an inconsistent
dynamic nodemap configuration across server targets.

This patch fixes this issue by explicitly clearing all dynamic
nodemaps on the MGS node if the MGS is co-located with an MDS or OSS.

The FIXME in Sanity-sec tests 72d and 72f was replaced to cover this
use case.
