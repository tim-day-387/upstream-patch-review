LU-16469 ldlm: read extent lock req can detect and return holes

For a sparse file, when the server handles a read extent DLM lock
enqueue request, it should also detect holes of the OST object and
return the hole information to the client.
By this way, the reader can directly zero the hole extents on the
client side locally without any I/O RPC to the server.

Add sanity/test_856f to verify it works as expected.
