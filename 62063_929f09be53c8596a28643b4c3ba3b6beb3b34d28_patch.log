LU-19527 lod: prevent parity mirrors from being write targets

Parity mirrors store erasure coding redundancy
information and should never be selected as write
targets. They can only be updated through resync
operations from their corresponding data mirrors.

Add checks in mirror selection logic to skip parity
mirrors when choosing a primary mirror for writes.

This patch adds:
- Check in lod_primary_pick() to skip parity mirrors
  when selecting primary mirror for writes
- Defensive checks in lod_declare_update_write_pending()
  to error out if non-stale parity mirror is found
