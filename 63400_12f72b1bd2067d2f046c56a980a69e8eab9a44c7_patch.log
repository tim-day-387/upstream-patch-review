LU-12064 obdclass: auto-scale at_min based on expected clients

When administrators set lustre_expected_clients, the system
now automatically calculates an appropriate at_min value using
the formula: ilog2(lustre_expected_clients) * 3

This provides:
- Small clusters (10 clients): at_min=9s (responsive)
- Medium clusters (500 clients): at_min=24s (balanced)
- Large clusters (5000 clients): at_min=36s (stable)
- Very large clusters (10000+ clients): at_min=39s+

Also adds conf-sanity test_164 that verifies the
functionality
