LU-18627 build: Enable gcov coverage

Enable code coverage in Lustre kernel and userspace code:

Add coverage as a configure option

Lustre kernel module coverage requires a kernel built with
  CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y

Module coverage also requires profiling enabled for specific
directories, a line similar to the following to the respective
kernel Makefile(build/Rules.in):
  GCOV_PROFILE := y

A lustre-coverage package will be created which holds the
lustre source and gcno files (gcov.tar.xz) and a script
lcov-merge.sh to collect coverage data from all nodes in the
cluster and run lcov [and fastcov] with the captured traces to
create a final report in html format. On RHEL/Fedora distros
the lustre-coverage packages depends on kernel-gcov package
which is generated when the kernel.spec is built '--with gcov'

Developers building or using kernels with CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL that
do not follow "the RHEL way" can build and use the dummy package:
  contrib-kernel-coverage.spec
available in the contrib directory to satisfy install dependencies
of the lustre-coverage package.

A spec in contrib: contrib-kernel-coverage.spec can be
built to provide the dependency instead, since most users
are only interested in Lustre coverage and not overly concerned
with full kernel coverage.
