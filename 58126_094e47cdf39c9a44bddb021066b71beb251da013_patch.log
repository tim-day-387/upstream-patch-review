LU-18725 utils: create ll_decode_lov

Like ll_decode_linkea, create ll_decode_lov.
This allows us to directly scan the MDT for information that can
be obtained with lfs getstripe.

The LOV printing functions are moved from liblustreapi.c to a new
file liblustreapi_lovea.c. This includes both raw printing functions
(for xattr buffer decoding) and wrapper functions (with path lookups).
