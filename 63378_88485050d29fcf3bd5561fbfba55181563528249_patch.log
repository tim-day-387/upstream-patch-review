LU-19775 tests: wait for applied limit in sanity-quota_96

sanity-quota_96("quota grant should be released when big files are
deleted") failed with: "DD should fail on first write". Wait until new
limits will be applied at OST0000 and OST0001 to address the problem.

Fixes: f472b887e3 ("LU-19068 quota: wait to release quota")
Test-Parameters: testlist=sanity-quota env=ONLY=96,ONLY_REPEAT=300
