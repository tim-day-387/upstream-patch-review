LU-12597 tests: remove comma_list for MDTs part 14

Most places that use $(mdts_nodes) also call $(comma_list ...) at the
same time.  Rather than returning a space-separated list of nodes from
those functions, instead return a comma-separated list suitable for
use by do_nodes() and similar functions calling pdsh internally.

This avoids the repeated calls to comma_list() and makes the tests
easier to read.  Also, since comma_list() internally deduplicates the
node list, it isn't necessary to do that in the callers.  A few tests
need to convert comma-separated osts_nodes into space-separated nodes.
