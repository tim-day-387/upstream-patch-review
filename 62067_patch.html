LU-18667 lustre: replace egrep and fgrep

Starting from GNU grep version 3.8, egrep and fgrep are
warned as obsolescent and should be replaced by grep -E
and grep -F.

  # cat /usr/bin/egrep
  #!/usr/bin/sh
  cmd=${0##*/}
  echo "$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -E" >&2
  exec grep -E "$@"

  # cat /usr/bin/fgrep
  #!/usr/bin/sh
  cmd=${0##*/}
  echo "$cmd: warning: $cmd is obsolescent; using grep -F" >&2
  exec grep -F "$@"

This patch replaces egrep and fgrep in Lustre codes to
eliminate the warnings.
