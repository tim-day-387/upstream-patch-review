LU-19692 mgc: notify MGS about target NIDs after reconnect

After MGS failover its NID tables should be rebuilt from targets
like it is done during initial target registration on mount.

For that the upcall is registered in MGC and called in
mgc_notify_active(), then upcall collect local NIDs data and
call tgt_nids_notify() to let MGS build NID tables for IR
