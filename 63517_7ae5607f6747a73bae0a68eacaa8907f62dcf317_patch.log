LU-1158 general: support ns timestamps with compatibility

Add backward compatibility for nanosecond timestamps between
clients and servers with different feature support levels.

Use OBD_CONNECT_NANOSEC_TIME flag to negotiate nanosecond
timestamp support during connection. When the flag is not set,
timestamps are exchanged in seconds for compatibility with
legacy clients and servers.

Client-side changes (llite, mdc):
- Add LL_NSEC_TIME_THRESHOLD (128 years in seconds) to detect
  whether received timestamps are in seconds or nanoseconds
- Convert seconds to nanoseconds when receiving from legacy
  servers in ll_update_inode(), ll_update_times(), and dir.c
- Convert nanoseconds to seconds when sending to legacy servers
  in mdc_create_pack(), mdc_open_pack(), mdc_setattr_pack()

Server-side changes (mdt, ofd):
- Add exp_connect_nanosec_time() to check client capability
- Convert nanoseconds to seconds in mdt_pack_attr2body() and
  ofd_lvbo_fill() when sending to legacy clients
- Convert seconds to nanoseconds in mdt_setattr_unpack_rec(),
  mdt_create_unpack(), mdt_open_unpack() when receiving from
  legacy clients
