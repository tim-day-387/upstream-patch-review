LU-9 lod: improve qos stripe allocation

Replace random OST selection with deterministic weighted round-robin
allocation that ensures proportional distribution based on OST
capacity and distributing the load across MDSs.

The previous QoS method relied on RNG to approximately
distribute stripes proportionally to OST weights, however this lead
to occasional unbalancing due to RNG variance. This new approach
uses a cursor-based system that increments by the average weight,
ensuring that OSTs with a higher weight will be hit more often
and OSTs with a lower weight will be skipped more often.

Key improvements:
- Deterministic allocation eliminates RNG variance
- Better load distribution across unbalanced OSTs
- Enhanced anti-aliasing to prevent clustering
- New aggressive rebalancing (prio_freee > 100%)
- prio_free <= 100% is now a linear slider between RR and QoS
- Comprehensive test coverage for allocation patterns

These features are now enabled by default through
  qos_threshold_rr=0
  qos_prio_free=100
which means that QoS is active if there is a difference of 0% or more
across target devices, and will balance directly proportional to the
target weights.
