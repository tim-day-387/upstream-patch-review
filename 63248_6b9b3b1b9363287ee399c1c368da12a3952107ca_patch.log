LU-19079 nodemap: allow switch to gss_id nodemap

If a client was initially part of a nodemap and gss authentication is
in place, the client should be kept as part of this nodemap when the
nodemap is switched to gssonly_identification.
To support this, add a new 'ps_nm_name' field in struct ptlrpc_sec to
store the nodemap name the import is associated with.

sanity-sec test_106 is added to exercise this.
