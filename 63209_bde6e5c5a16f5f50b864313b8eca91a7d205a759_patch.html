LU-13903 build: allow building for a kernel with native client

Currently we can build just the Lustre utilites on a system with
a installed kernel with native Lustre client support. This doesn't
work for building against a kernel tree with the native lustre
client i.e

./configure --disable-modules --disable-server --with-linux=~/lustre-upstream

This patch adds takes the kernel header location and adds it to
the CPPFLAGS. The tools then can be built against that set of
headers.

Test-Parameters: trivial
