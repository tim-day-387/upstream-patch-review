LU-19771 tests: Add more lfsck test coverasge

Augment / Claude Opus 4.5 agent identified some possible gaps
in lfsck testing coverage and added some tests:

| Test | Purpose | OBD_FAIL Points Tested |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| test_46 | Network notification failure between MDTs |
OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_NOTIFY_NET (0x16f0) |
| test_47 | Network query failure between MDTs |
OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_QUERY_NET (0x16f1) |
| test_48 | LUDA_UPGRADE/LUDA_REPAIR entry handling | - |
| test_49 | Transient lock/transaction failures | OBD_FAIL_OBD_DQACQ
(0x604) |
| test_50 | Concurrent file operations during scan |
OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_DELAY1 (0x1600) |
| test_51 | Bad dirent types in regular directories |
OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_BAD_TYPE (0x1623) |
| test_52 | LinkEA overflow handling | - |
| test_53 | Dot-sequence FID directory handling | - |

Coverage Improvements

  • Network failures: Previously untested OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_NOTIFY_NET and
    OBD_FAIL_LFSCK_QUERY_NET are now covered
  • Error recovery: Transient failure handling is now explicitly tested
  • Concurrency: Tests verify LFSCK behavior with concurrent file
    operations
  • Edge cases: LinkEA overflow, special directories, and LUDA_UPGRADE
    paths are now tested
