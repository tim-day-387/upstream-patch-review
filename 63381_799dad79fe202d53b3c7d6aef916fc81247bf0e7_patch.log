LU-18813 osd: setup library to share code

... starting with osd_obj_seq/map routines. These will
be eventually used by osd-wbcfs as well - so move them
to a dedicated osd.ko kernel module. A new kernel module
is desirable (versus a static library) so that we preserve
the ability to load multiple OSDs at the same time.
