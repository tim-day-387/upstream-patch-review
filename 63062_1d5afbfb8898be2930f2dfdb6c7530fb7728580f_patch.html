LU-12668 ec: always initialize all comps on creation when ec is used

Do not defer stripe allocation when creating the layout when creating
a new file.
We need to have all components initialized and also populated with
stripes so that we will be able to both compute the number
od raidsets as well as being able to guarantee that all OSTs
fulfill the uniqueness quarantees.
