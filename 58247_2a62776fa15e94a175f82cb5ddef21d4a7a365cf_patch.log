LU-17916 osc: switch to struct folio

Switch from struct page and page based API to struct folio
and the folio API.

When getting user pages with get_user_pages et. al. as
is used for direct i/o mechanical conversion of page to
folio has to consider the case of huge pages and the
same folio if retrieved for many pages.

So the original offset to the page must be passed down
and used when working with the pages in bulk r/w and
page encryption.

This prepares the osc brw for handing such folios.
