LU-19726 tests: additional output for vbr test suite failures

There are a handful of test case failures that have happened
more than once, but not frequently enough to easily replicate.
The goal of these small changes to test-framework.sh is to
add a slightly longer window for nodes to shutdown, while also
printing uptime info in case of future failures.
