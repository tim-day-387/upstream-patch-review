LU-18299 tests: increase runtests deletion time

There may be some delays in releasing OST objects (and their space)
due to async close RPCs, MDT destroy queue, etc.  Wait longer for
deletes to complete rather than failing the test intermittently.

Test-Parameters: trivial testlist=runtests env=ONLY=1,ONLY_REPEAT=100
