LU-18562 tests: fix sanity-dom/151i[bc] for extent MDT

The MDT ldiskfs formatting options were changed to use extents
by default, in order to improve llog allocation performance.
This caused sanity-dom test_151ib and test_151ic to fail 100%
of test sessions for the past 3 months, because they expected
indirect block allocation counts for all DoM files.

Fix these subtests to allow either indirect or extent mapped block
allocation, since the exact number of blocks is not critical, but
rather fallocate allocates *about that many* blocks to DoM files.
