LU-19791 quota: preserve OSD_QID_FORCE for async writes

When project quota is enabled with root_prj_enable=1, the
osd_declare_inode_qid() function was incorrectly resetting
the 'force' variable when QUOTA_FL_ROOT_PRJQUOTA was set.
This caused OSD_QID_FORCE (set for async/buffered writes)
to be lost, resulting in quota enforcement on async writes.

The consequence is silent data loss: write() succeeds as
pages go to cache, but writeback fails with -EDQUOT and
the data is silently discarded.

The fix preserves OSD_QID_FORCE by only resetting 'force'
to th->th_ignore_quota when OSD_QID_FORCE is not set. This
ensures async writes bypass quota enforcement as intended,
while still allowing root_prj_enable to disable quota bypass
for sync writes (where CAP_SYS_RESOURCE would normally apply).

Add test_98 to sanity-quota.sh to verify async writes with
project quota and root_prj_enable preserve data.

This fix and test were developed by Augment/Claude Opus,
