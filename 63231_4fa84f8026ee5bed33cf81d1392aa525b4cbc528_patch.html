LU-19750 ptlrpc: llog client to set mdt_body

mdt_changelog_allow() has a check preventing "new" clients
(after 2.17+) accessing changelog if no correct credentials
are provided in mdt_body structure.  This is not provided
because llog_client_open() is used with nameless changelogs
and the client can't access mdt_body buffer set after
undefined name buffer.

If a llog (e.g. changelog) is nameless, then name buffer is
not set and we can't use mdt_body buffer - no credentials
and no access to changelogs.

Fixes: 4e8fcee92d ("LU-13064 sec: check permissions for changelogs access")
