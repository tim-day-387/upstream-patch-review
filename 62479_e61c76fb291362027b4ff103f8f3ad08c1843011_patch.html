LU-19298 lod: use Xarray instead of static arrays for comp entires

The LOD layer implements very large static arrays to manage the
component entries for each layout. This works well for the case
that all the components are for block I/O that are expected to
be aligned to each other in a specific order. In such cases the
API works to add or delete components at the end of such layouts.
With the upcoming introducting of parity and foreign components
the rules change in that you can delete or add a component
located in the middle of the layout. This would be very
complicated when using static arrays.

To make life easier for upcoming projects we move away from
static arrays to using Xarrays. We no longer requires creating
a whole new array and copying components over. Instead we just
insert or delete components into the Xarray. This current
implementation just does the change from static arrary to
Xarray without truly introducing gaps in the Xarray. This can
be done in follow on patches and can be used to greatly simplify
the code. For example since "gaps" are allowed in the Xarray
we can place components in the Xarray using the mirror id as
apart of the index which mirrors the component ID. This removes
the need to manage the new mirror ranges in the Xarray.
