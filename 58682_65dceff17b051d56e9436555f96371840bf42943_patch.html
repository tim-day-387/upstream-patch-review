LU-18687 lib: move libcfs userspace library

Move the libcfs userspace library to the top-level
lib directory. Eventually, all of the userspace
tools and libraries will live alongside it.

We move *.c files:
from: libcfs/libcfs/util/*.c
to: lib/libcfs/*.c

We move *.h files:
from: libcfs/include/libcfs/util/*.h
to: include/libcfs/util/*.h

Test-Parameters: trivial
