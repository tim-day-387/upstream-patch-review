LU-18813 osd-wbcfs: remove calls to alloc_file_pseudo()

Duplicate the work of "LU-19388 osd: remove calls to alloc_file_pseudo()"
but for osd-wbcfs.

fput() which we need to call after alloc_file_pseudo() doesn't release
file struct right away and postponed jobs to release it may create
a massive load to system interrupting regular Lustre processing.

The reason for using alloc_file_pseudo() was due to the removal
of kallsyms_lookup_name(). The function iterate_dir() will crash
unless security_file_alloc() and security_file_free() are not
called. Now that Lustre uses kprobes to export functions we
can unwind the work of LU-13783.
