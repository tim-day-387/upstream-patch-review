LU-19827 lnet: Fix MR forwarding

The change https://review.whamcloud.com/57492 introduced a regression
in the multi-rail forwarding code. MR forwarding allows a router to
select a different target interface for a message when the one chosen
by the sender is down or unhealthy.

Prior to the above change, lnet_is_peer_ni_alive() would check both
the down and unhealthy criteria, but now it only checks the down
criteria. We need to add a check for the peer NI's health value.

There was also a second bug here where we were inadvertently checking
the MR capability of the destination peer rather than the source peer.
This is also fixed.

Add sanity-lnet tests to validate MR forwarding feature
