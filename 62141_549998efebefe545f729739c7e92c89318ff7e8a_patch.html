LU-19551 nodemap: deny setting default quota offset nodemap

When a client is associated with a nodemap that has offsets defined,
the nodemap maps the PROJID and UID for ID 0 to the offset (depending
on the offset, it may also be squashed). Therefore, a root user of
such a nodemap can attempt to set the default quota (ID 0) but it is
actually offset.

Instead, tenant root users should get an error (EPERM) when trying to
set the default quota, so that only the "global root" user can set the
tenant nodemap. This patch implements this error case.
