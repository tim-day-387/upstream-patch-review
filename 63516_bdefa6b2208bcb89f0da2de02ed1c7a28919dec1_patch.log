LU-1158 general: support nanosecond timestamps

Change most s64 timestamps in memory from epoch seconds to
epoch nanoseconds. Change the variable names from
xxx_(a/m/c)time to xxx_(a/m/c)time_ns to indicate this change.

Exceptions that remain in seconds:
- struct ost_lvb_v1: wire protocol for backwards compatibility
  with old clients

Compatibility will be implemented in a second patch.
