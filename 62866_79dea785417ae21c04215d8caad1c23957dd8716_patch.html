LU-17000 lnet: Remove redundant NULL check

Remove redundant NULL check for pointer net_l.
It would be impossible for net_l to be NULL as
it would be already set after lnet_net_unique().
And it being used by list_for_each_entry to iterate
list. If 'net_l' was NULL it would crash already.

CoverityID: 399690 ("Dereference before null check")
