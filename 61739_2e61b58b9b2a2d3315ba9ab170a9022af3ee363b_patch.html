LU-19079 utils: function to get nodemap name from sha256

Introduce function in gss-related utils to get the name of a nodemap
from its sha256. This is done by sending an LCFG_NODEMAP_LOOKUP_SHA
ioctl, which returns -EPERM if the nodemap does not have the
gssonly_identification property set.
Issuing the ioctl requires to find out the ioctl device to use for the
server on which the lsvcgssd daemon is running.
Rename ioc_dev (un)register functions to llapi_(un)register_ioc_*() to
avoid namespace pollution.
