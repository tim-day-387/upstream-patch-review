LU-19696 lnet: delete all efa intf at once

We can delete EFA interfaces one by one using cmd:
    lnetctl net del --net efa --if if_name
But the following cmd does not take effect:
    lnetctl net del --net efa
This is because no ioctl call is made if nnids==0 and
net type is EFA. The fix is just to add the ioctl call.
