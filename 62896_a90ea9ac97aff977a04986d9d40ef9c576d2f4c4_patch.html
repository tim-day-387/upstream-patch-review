LU-19671 obd: introduce subsystem specific dump on eviction

Lustre has options to dump logs or crash on eviction events,
including: LDLM lock eviction, client [re]connect eviction,
stale recovery eviction

The options obd_lbug_on_eviction and obd_dump_on_eviction control
crash/log behavior. This patch adds ability to set these options with
a mask for specific subsystems:
- 1: all minus pinger (old behavior)
- 2: client eviction
- 4: LDLM lock eviction
- 8: recovery stale eviction
- 16: pinger eviction (new)

Also adds log dumping and LBUG behavior for pinger evictions, which
previously did not produce logs or crashes.
