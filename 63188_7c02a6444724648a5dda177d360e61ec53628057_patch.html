LU-17240 tests: enable parallel mounting by default

Enable parallel mounting of targets within types by default.
This allows multiple OSTs (or MDTs in multi-MDT configurations)
to be mounted simultaneously, but maintains sequential ordering
between different target types (MDT before OST).

Configuration:
- PARALLEL_MOUNT now defaults to 1 (enabled)
- PARALLEL_MOUNT_TYPES explicitly set to 0 (no inter-type overlap)
- PARALLEL_MOUNT_TARGETS="mdt ost" (MGS excluded)

Test environment:
- 1 MGS (combined with MDS)
- 1 MDT (245MB)
- 2 OSTs (391MB each)

Performance results:
- Baseline (serial mounting): 29.7s
- Parallel mounting within types: 27.3s
- Improvement: 8% faster (2.4s savings)
