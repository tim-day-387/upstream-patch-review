LU-19527 lod: block prefer flags on parity components

Parity components in EC mirrors should not have prefer
flags (LCME_FL_PREF_RW, LCME_FL_PREF_RD, LCME_FL_PREF_WR)
set on them, as they are not meant to be used for normal
I/O operations. Parity components contain parity data
(similar to RAID parity), not user data, so directing I/O
to them would be incorrect.

This patch adds:
- Server-side enforcement in lod_declare_layout_set() to
  reject setting prefer flags on parity components
- Client-side validation in lfs_component_set() to
  provide user-friendly error messages
- Test coverage in sanity-ec.sh test_6a using current EC
  creation syntax
