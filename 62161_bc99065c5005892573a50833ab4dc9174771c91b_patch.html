LU-19553 dkms: inject depends on other dkms packages

When mlnx-ofed-kernel-dkms has been installed but not yet
built (new kernel has not yet booted) installing
lustre-client-dkms
fails to build correctly (due to building against an old set
of symbols).

This is theoretically true for several other possible
packages that lustre could be depending upon.

mlnx-ofed-kernel
zfs
cray-kfabric (and its dependencies)
  [cray-cxi-driver, cray-slingshot-base-link, kdreg2, sl-driver]

HPE-bug-id: LUS-12975
Test-Parameters: trivial testgroup=full-dkms
