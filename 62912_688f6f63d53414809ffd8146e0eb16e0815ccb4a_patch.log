LU-12668 ec: Update lod_ost_alloc_rr to be parity aware

When allocating OSTs using lod_ost_alloc_rr, if this
extent will be part of a parity protected mirror pair
then enforce that ALL OSTs in both the data and the ec
mirrors are unique.

This is strict but safe. Later work can soften this
restriction to only enforce unique OSTs within each
raidset instead.
