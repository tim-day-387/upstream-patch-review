LU-19520 ec: don't read parity comp on old clients

* Add layout_pattern_supported() so that it allows clients to set
  new type of layout and server also use it to check the validity
  of the layout passed by clients.

* Clients then use lov_pattern_supported() to check what type of
  layout pattern it understand to exercise IO upon it.

* CLIO also checks whether it understand the component by
  lov_supported_comp_flags(), as parity component would also set
  LCME_FL_PARITY in its component flags.
