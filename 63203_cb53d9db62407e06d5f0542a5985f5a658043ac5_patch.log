LU-19746 mgs: disable connections with noclient option

Both the replace_nid and clear_conf operations require the
clients/servers to be unmounted. And it is hard to handle for
thousands of clients. Let's simplified this with a new mount MGS
option. The fix adds a new mount option - noclient. It disables
remote client connections.
