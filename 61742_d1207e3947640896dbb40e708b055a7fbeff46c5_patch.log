LU-19079 sec: gss token for nodemap identification

Put into the security context the nodemap name retrieved during GSS
authentication. This nodemap name is then used to apply nodemap
membership of exports at target connect and reconnect.
The consequence is that a nodemap with no associated NID ranges but
with the gssonly_identification property set will take membership of
clients solely based on the nodemap name associated with the strong
authentication token used for GSS context negotiation.

For this purpose the function nodemap_add_member() is enhanced to
take an extra struct ptlrpc_svc_ctx * parameter, to be able to fetch
the nodemap name from the security context. This enables making an
export part of a nodemap while the corresponding client NID is not
part of the nodemap range. Thus this is restricted to nodemaps with
the gssonly_identification property set.

Add sanity-sec test_79 to demonstrate the feature.
