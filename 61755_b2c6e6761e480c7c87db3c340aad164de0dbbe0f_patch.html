LU-19157 nodemap: support banlist with gss identification

Nodemaps that have the gssonly_identification property set accept
clients based on the GSS token they use to authenticate, rather than
their NIDs.
We need to support defining banlists for such nodemaps, whereas they
do not accept regular NID ranges. And once clients are associated with
a nodemap based on their GSS token, we need to find out if the nodemap
bans them.

Enhance sanity-sec test_79 to exercise this.
