LU-18461 layout: allow to be started from zero offset.

Traditional PFL objects have a hole at the start to accommodate the DoM
object if it needs to be migrated. This is not always necessary, however,
as the hole can prevent the use of large files with a small number of OST
objects in the ldiskfs backend.

Introducing the ability to eliminate this
hole at the beginning could provide an opportunity for OST objects to be
moved across components and offsets, and allow for a greater number of OST
objects to be stored in larger files. Additionally, multiple files could be
combined into one, similar to the join file feature of the past, once
components are able to be relocated.
