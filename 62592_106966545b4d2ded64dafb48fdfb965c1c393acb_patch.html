LU-8229 ssk: support auth against multiple similar keys

Enhance server-side authentication routine in userspace (lsvcgssd) to
support multiple similar keys. This can be useful for implementing a
key rotation mechanism.

Server-side now cycles through all keys in the kernel keyring whose
description starts with 'lustre:<fsname>:<nodemap name>', instead of
an exact match.  If authentication fails with the first key in the
keyring, then the authentication process is restarted with other
matching keys, until all keys have been tried.

sanity-sec test_103 is added to exercise the ability to add multiple
keys on server side, and carry out authentication on any of them used
by clients.

Test-Parameters: trivial
Test-Parameters: testgroup=review-dne-selinux-ssk-part-1
Test-Parameters: testgroup=review-dne-selinux-ssk-part-2
Test-Parameters: kerberos=true testlist=sanity-krb5
