LU-12187 tests: add EC tests for -N (mirror mode)

Add comprehensive tests for EC (Erasure Coding) with -N option
to verify that EC works correctly in mirror mode.

Tests cover:
- Single data mirror with EC using -N
- Two data mirrors, one with EC
- Two data mirrors, both with EC
- Multiple identical EC mirrors using -N count
- Mixed regular and EC mirrors

These tests currently fail as -N with --ec is not yet
implemented, but provide the test framework for verifying
the implementation.
