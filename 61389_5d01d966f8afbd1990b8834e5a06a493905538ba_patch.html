LU-14144 utils: allow /sys/module/OBD/parameters/*

Allows 'lctl {get|list}_param' to get parameters from
/sys/module/OBD_DEV/parameters/*. This means that many of the
parameters duplicated in /sys/fs/lustre/OBD_DEV/* can be removed.

Move mounting of /sys/kernel/debug into its own helper function.
Remove RHEL6 compatibility cruft from cfs_get_param_paths().

Remove /proc/sys/lnet and /proc/net/lnet from search paths, since they
have not been used since Lustre 2.10.

Some tests were using at_min as a test_parameter but at_min
is also a module parameter so it would appear twice.
