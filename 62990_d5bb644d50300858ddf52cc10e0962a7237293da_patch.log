LU-19079 sec: update nodemap membership on flavor change

When a security flavor is updated on an export (e.g. from null to skn)
the client needs to refresh or create a gss context. Now that we have
GSS based nodemaps, it is useful to lookup the nodemap entries when
this happens, to see if the client now belongs to a different nodemap,
based on its gss context.

Add sanity-sec test_105 to exercise this feature.
