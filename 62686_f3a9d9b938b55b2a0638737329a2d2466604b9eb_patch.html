LU-17240 tests: remove unnecessary sleep in setupall

This sleep was designed to allow MDT-OST connections to
stabilize, but they should be fully ready once the mount
completes.

The sleep may still be required for GSS configurations,
which say they need it for a different reason.

Saves 3-5 seconds in test setup time.
