LU-17240 tests: enable parallel mounting across types

Enable inter-type parallelism for mount operations, allowing
MDT and OST mounting to overlap rather than waiting for MDT
to complete before starting OST mounts.

Configuration:
- PARALLEL_MOUNT_TYPES now inherits from PARALLEL_MOUNT (=1)
- Allows MDT and OST mounts to run simultaneously

Test environment:
- 1 MGS (combined with MDS)
- 1 MDT (245MB)
- 2 OSTs (391MB each)

Performance results:
- Baseline (sequential types): 24.9s
- With inter-type overlap: 26.8s
- Result: 8% slower (1.9s penalty)

Note: Inter-type mount parallelism shows a small performance
degradation in this configuration. The overhead of running
MDT and OST mounts simultaneously appears to outweigh any
parallelism benefits, likely due to resource contention or
mount dependencies. This feature is enabled for completeness
and may show benefits in larger configurations.
