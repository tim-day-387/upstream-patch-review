LU-19527 tests: add nosync flag test for parity mirrors

Parity mirrors in EC files can have the nosync flag set
to prevent them from being updated during resync
operations, effectively creating a snapshot of the
parity data at a point in time.

This patch adds test coverage in sanity-ec.sh test_6f
to verify that:
- The nosync flag can be set on parity components
- Parity mirrors with nosync remain stale after resync
- Parity mirror data is preserved when nosync is set
- Clearing nosync allows normal resync to proceed
