LU-19733 ptlrpc: skip NIDs on missing networks

Prevent usage of a NID on network which is missing locally,
e.g. in a setup when client configured networks are subset
of server networks, like in multi-tenancy setups

Patch does the following:
- create/export LNetHasLocalNet() supplimentary function
- don't add NID with missing networks in uuid_nid_data
  structure where connection possible NIDs are stored
- skip peer creation on missing network in LNetAddPeer()
  and LNetPeerDiscovered() functions called from Lustre
