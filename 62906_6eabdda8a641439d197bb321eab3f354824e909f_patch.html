LU-12668 ec: try map ec mirror to data mirror during creation

When creating a layout and allocating OSTs for the
different components, if creating a parity component
try to find the matching data component so we know how
many stripes are in the data component.
We need this in order to compute how many raidsets
there will be so that we can request to allocate one
OST per parity per raidset for the parity component.
