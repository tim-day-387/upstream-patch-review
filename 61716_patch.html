LU-8066 mgs: migrate files out of procfs

Move all the simple proc files to sysfs. The more complex files
get moved to debugfs. The MGS layer was the last to use
lprocfs_evict_client_seq_write(). We can instead use the already
existing evice_client_store() that is already being used by other
obd device layers.
