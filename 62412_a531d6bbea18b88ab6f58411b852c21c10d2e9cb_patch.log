LU-19503 doc: Clarify quota limit enforcement behavior

Add documentation noting that Lustre quota limits are
not strictly enforced due to client-side caching, and
should preferably be configured in the GB range.

Reorganize the DESCRIPTION section to have a shorter
section for each command variant, and move the arguments
to a new OPTIONS section instead of repeating them.

Reformat to follow current man page style guidelines.
