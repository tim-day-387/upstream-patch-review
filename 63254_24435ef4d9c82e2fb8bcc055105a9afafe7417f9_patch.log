LU-19759 llite: reject pipe iterators for direct IO

NFS splice reads pass pipe iterators to ll_direct_IO_impl.
The existing check only rejected pipe iterators for
unaligned DIO, but pipe iterators also cannot work with
aligned DIO because iov_iter_get_pages_alloc2() cannot pin
pages from pipe buffers.

This caused issues when hybrid IO was enabled with a low
read threshold, as NFS splice reads would attempt DIO with
a pipe iterator, leading to potential memory access issues.

Reject all pipe iterators for DIO and fall back to buffered
IO. Additionally, add a check in ll_hybrid_bio_dio_switch_
check() to prevent hybrid IO from switching to DIO for pipe
iterators, since the DIO code should reject it, but we also
shouldn't ask in the first place.
