LU-19673 osp: increase default max_rpcs_in_progress

it's 4096 currently and it's possible to overflow osp llog calling
chown in a loop - because MDS-to-OSP synchronization is throttled
by this tunable. we also do not want to set it too high as this
number of RPCs is pinned on MDS until OST have them committed: with
1K RPC memory footprint this can consume hundreds MBs of RAM on MDS.

add an extra check in osp to monitor llog operations. if osp llog
has been growing only for 320+ seconds, then print a warning:

Lustre: 5539:0:(osp_sync.c:401:osp_sync_llog_health_check())
lustre-OST0000-osc-MDT0000: 2 plain llogs, was 2, check MDS-OST sync
