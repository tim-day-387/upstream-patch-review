LU-19796 kfilnd: fix sg_table free after orig_nents overwrite

The kfilnd transaction code was overwriting sg_table.orig_nents
with the actual number of populated segments to work around
dma_[un]map_sgtable() requirements. However, orig_nents must
remain the original allocation size so sg_free_table() can
determine whether to dismantle a chained multi-page table or
just issue kfree().

This caused kernel warnings in free_nonslab_page() when freeing
transactions with scatter-gather tables:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 806 at mm/slub.c:3591 free_nonslab_page+0x70/0x90
  Call Trace:
    kfree+0x20e/0x250
    __sg_free_table+0x5f/0x80
    kfilnd_tn_free+0x23a/0x3a0 [kkfilnd]

The fix introduces tn_sgt_alloc_nents to save the original
allocation size and kfilnd_tn_sgt_free() to restore orig_nents
before calling sg_free_table(). This preserves the allocation
metadata needed for proper cleanup while still allowing the
dma mapping functions to work with only the populated segments.

Additional changes:
- Move tn_num_iovec outside HAVE_KFI_SGL ifdef since it's only
  used in the non-SGL code path
- Update debug messages to use tn_sgt.nents instead of the
  removed tn_num_iovec assignment
- Add alloc_nents to debug output for better diagnostics
