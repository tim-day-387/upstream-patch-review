LU-19147 osd-ldiskfs: tune readcache_max_filesize default based on RAM size

The default readcache_max_filesize was set to OSD_MAX_CACHE_SIZE
(OBD_OBJECT_EOF), which effectively means no limit on file size
for caching.

Change the default to scale with actual RAM size using
(totalram_pages() << PAGE_SHIFT) / 64, which allocates approximately
1.6% of total system memory for file caching
