LU-19671 obd: introduce subsystem specific dump on eviction

Lustre has options to dump logs or crash on eviction events,
including: LDLM lock eviction, client [re]connect eviction,
stale recovery eviction.

The options obd_lbug_on_eviction and obd_dump_on_eviction control
crash/log behavior. This patch adds ability to set these options with
a mask or string for specific subsystems:
- '1'/0x01: all minus pinger (old behavior)
- 'llite'/0x02: client eviction
- 'ldlm'/0x04: LDLM lock eviction
- 'stale'/0x08: recovery stale eviction
- 'pinger'/0x10: pinger eviction (new)

lctl set_param dump_on_eviction=pinger,ldlm,stale
lctl set_param lbug_on_eviction=0x14

Also adds log dumping and LBUG behavior for pinger evictions, which
previously did not produce logs or crashes.
