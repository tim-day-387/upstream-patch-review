DO NOT MERGE LU-19465 ec: add erasure code as a separate library

It contains the plain-C version of the upstream library taken at version
v2.31.0-104-ge677f66
The files are mostly un-modified to make it easy to verify and compare
them to upstream, or just dropping in new/updated versions when
required.

Split the kernel module into a wrapper, ec_kmod.c, and the actual
erasure code, ec_base.c.

Later patch will add optimized assembler versions using the vector
units when available.
