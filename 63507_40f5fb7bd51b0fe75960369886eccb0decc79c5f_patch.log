LU-13773 tests: propagate sanity-dom sanity/n FAIL

If one of the sanity.sh or sanityn.sh subtests fail while running
sanity-som, the errors are logged, but test_sanity and test_sanityn
do not report a failure due to "return 0" at the end.  This allows
regressions in DoM functionality to be landed unnoticed (e.g.
LU-18562 changed MDT formatting and caused sanity test_151ib/151ic
to fail 100% of test runs).

Return an error if the sanity or sanityn subtest run fails.

Fixes: 1140d209f0 ("LU-10589 tests: insulate sanity-dom from test failures")
Test-Parameters: trivial testlist=sanity-dom
