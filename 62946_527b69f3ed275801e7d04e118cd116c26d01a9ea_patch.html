LU-19598 utils: implement ltrash_purge tool

This patch implements ltrash_purge daemon to automatically
purge files from Lustre Trash Can based on the different
configurable policies.

It has the following features:
 1.Multiple purging policies:
   - Space-based policy for mdt and ost (default: 90%)
   - Age-based policy (default: 30 days)
   - User-based policy (UID/GID/PROJID)
 2.Different operational modes:
   - Daemon mode: continuous monitoring with scan intervals
     (default: 60s)
   - Dry-run mode: scan and report without deleting files
   - Empty mode: purge all files from Trash Can regardless of
     filters
 3.Performance optimizations:
   - Efficient traversal using llapi_find_with_cb() with custom
     callbacks
   - Parallel scanning and purging (default: 4 threads)
   - Usage checks every N deletions to avoid excessive overhead
 4.Statistics and monitoring:
   - Enable(by default) and disable statistics tracking
     (scanned/purged objects, freed bytes)
   - Yaml-formatted stat dump on SIGUSR1 signal
   - Configurable dump file location
 5.Configuration:
   - Config file at /etc/ltrash_purge.conf by default
   - Command-line options override config file settings
   - PID file locking to prevent multiple instances
     (default: /var/run/ltrash_purge.pid)
 6.Signal handling:
   - SIGUSR1: dump statistics to file
   - SIGINT/SIGTERM: graceful shutdown

The following tests are added to sanityn.sh to verify this patch:
 - test_119a: dry-run and empty modes
 - test_119b: space-based purging with MDT/OST watermarks
 - test_119c: age-based purging with max_age filter
 - test_119d: ID-based filtering (UID/GID/PROJID)
 - test_119e: config file and --disable-stats option
