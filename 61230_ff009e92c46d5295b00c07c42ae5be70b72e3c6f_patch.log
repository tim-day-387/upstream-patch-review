LU-19344 llite: set read size correctly

The problem with the extent lock  is that it don't update an i_size
after lock lost and enqueue new one.  To solve this, vvp_prep_size
was created.
However, it can only handle two out of three cases:

1. When the extent lock has been lost and there is no valid size
   available, a glimpse is sent.
2. When the lock has been renewed and the size has increased,
   the i_size is updated to the minimal known size.

in some cases, the size might decrease after the lock renewal. If
this happens, it is safe to change the i_size to kms, as the i_size
value is not accurate anyway. Size can be changed if it's not
protected by ldlm locks for all stripes, but it don't update an
i_size. Users should call the stat() function if the size needs to be
set correctly for this point.

Test sanity 251b was removed because of an incorrect assumption. The
read after the write should never return an end-of-file (EOF). While
the test started from a 5-second  sleep before, the write started 2
seconds after the read starts, so the writer should have finished
before the read. Once the test was run on the same node, the write
will update the i_size, and the read would see this update to copy
data.
