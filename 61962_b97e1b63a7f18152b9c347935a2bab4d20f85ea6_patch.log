LU-12187 llapi: EC layout creation support

Client changes to allow validation of ECed layouts in llapi.

This includes setting up a bi-directional linkage between data and
parity components when a parity component is created. This 1-1
relationship is enforced such that a data component can only be
protected by one parity component.

Added llapi_layout_test tests 40-60 to exercise the layout changes.
