LU-13091 tests: test to vereify parameter names

This teest verifies that parameter names are not being changed or
removed by tests. This has been an issue in the past with code
cleanup between procfs, sysfs, and ddebugfs where parameter names
have been removed, renamed,or moveed to some other location without
any of the regression tests failing.

A list of all parameters is located in lustre/tests/lctl-params.log
which will need to be updated if ever a parameter is changed or
removed.

Test-Parameters: trivial
Test-Parameters: testlist=conf-sanity.sh env=ONLY=10b
