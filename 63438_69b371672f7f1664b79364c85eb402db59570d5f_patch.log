LU-13091 tests: test to verify parameter names

This test verifies that parameter names are not being changed or
removed by patches. This has been an issue in the past with code
cleanup between procfs, sysfs, and debugfs where parameter names
have been removed, renamed, or moved to some other location without
any of the regression tests failing.

A list of per facet parameters located in
'lustre/tests/lctl-params-$facet.log'
which will need to be updated if ever a parameter is intentionally
updated.
