LU-12738 mdd: enable append_stripe_count=1 by default

Re-enable mdd.*.append_stripe_count=1 by default until the client and
MDS can negotiate whether an appending write will instantiate all of
the components of the file or not.

This is needed temporarily to ensure that old clients do not cause
problems for MDS servers that do not enable append layouts by default.
