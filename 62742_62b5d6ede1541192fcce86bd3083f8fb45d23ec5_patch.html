LU-17240 tests: fix dm-flakey device handling

The recent parallel unmount commit attempted to fix
device name functions to return the actual mounted
device for dm-flakey support, but this created circular
dependencies during initialization that caused hangs.

The proper solution is to add a new facet_real_dev()
function that returns the currently mounted device
(which could be a dm-flakey device) when the facet is
mounted, or falls back to the logical device name when
unmounted.

This is needed because direct device access tools like
debugfs, tune2fs, dumpe2fs, and e2fsck need to access
the actual mounted device (dm-flakey) to see current
filesystem state, not the underlying physical device
which may have stale data buffered in the dm layer.

Updated all test code that uses these tools to call
facet_real_dev() instead of ostdevname() or mdsdevname()
to get the correct device for direct access.
