LU-17240 tests: enable parallel unmounting by default

Enable parallel unmounting of targets within types by default.
This allows multiple clients, OSTs, or MDTs to be unmounted
simultaneously within their respective type groups, but maintains
sequential ordering between different target types (clients, then
MDTs, then OSTs).

Configuration:
- PARALLEL_UMOUNT now defaults to 1 (enabled)
- PARALLEL_UMOUNT_TYPES remains 0 (no inter-type overlap)
- PARALLEL_UMOUNT_TARGETS="client mdt ost"

Test environment:
- 1 MGS (combined with MDS)
- 1 MDT (245MB)
- 2 OSTs (391MB each)

Performance results:
- Baseline (serial unmounting): 30.9s
- Parallel unmounting within types: 26.5s
- Improvement: 14% faster (4.4s savings)
