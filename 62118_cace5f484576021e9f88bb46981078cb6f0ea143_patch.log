LU-19469 osc: add tunable for size threshold to cache hole

Add a tunable for the minimum page count threshold to determine
whether cache a hole extent on the rbtree of an OSC object on a
client.
	lctl set_param osc.*.hole_extent_kb=64

It is set with 16 pages (64KiB in size) by default.
Setting its value with "-1" will disable the client-side hole
extent caching.
