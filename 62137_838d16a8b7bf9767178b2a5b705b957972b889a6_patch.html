LU-11509 ldlm: introduce ldlm_lock_cache_policy layer

This is the 2nd patch of LU-11509. It introduces an abstraction
layer for ldlm_lock_cache_policy, and moves the existing LRU/LFRU
implementation into the new file, lock_cache_policy. LFRU is the
default policy.

During this restructuring, we also tighten the criteria for
ldlm_lfru_priv_too_many(), making it more strict to prevent
too many privilege locks from being held in the cache.

This serves as a starting point, enabling us to easily add
more cache policies like ARC in the near future.

Note: We have only reorganized the cache APIs for now.
LRU/LFRU-related members currently scattered throughout the
ldlm_namespace remain untouched in this commit.
