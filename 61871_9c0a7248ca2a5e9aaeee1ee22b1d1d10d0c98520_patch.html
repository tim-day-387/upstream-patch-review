LU-19488 tests: FORCE_LARGE_NID on remote env

In do_nodes, we need to export some variables to be able to have them
from remote nodes. FORCE_LARGE_NID was added into the list of
variables exported by get_env_vars.
Autotest does not suffer from this issue. It seems env variables are
outside test-framework.sh. Thus, no special test is needed to check
this patch.
