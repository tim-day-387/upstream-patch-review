LU-12187 ec: accomodate ec layout at LOD

Modify the LOD to support the erasure-coding layout. We support
taking the incoming lmm from the client in compressed form and
then change it to a 1 to 1 mapping. The parity components are
stored in a Xarray using the data component index that is being
parityt checked. This allows us to easily determine if a data
component is being checked and we can locate easily locate the
EC component to mark it stale for example. The reverse is also
true in that we compress the data before sending the data to
the client.

This provides the most basic support to allow setup for a
file layout with EC components. Currently we don't store any
EC setup data on disk so inherit is not supported with EC at
this time. Since we can having so many EC components which
multiple even more with mirrors a separate xattr will be
needed to prevent overflows. That will de done in a latter
patch.
