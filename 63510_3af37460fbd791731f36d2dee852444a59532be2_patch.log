LU-12187 tests: allow 'hole' in sanity-lfsck/20[ab]

The "lfs getstripe" layout pattern for a file with a 'hole' in it
(missing OST objects) is being improved in the EC patch series.
Previously it just printed a numeric layout pattern "40000001", but
now it will print "raid0,hole", which is more useful for users.

Update sanity-lfsck test_20a and test_20b to accept both formats.
