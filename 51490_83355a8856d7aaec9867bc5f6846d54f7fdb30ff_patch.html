LU-12188 ec: handle user land EC layout setup

Make the user land tools aware of the new parity components.
Changes done to support EC are:

1) Updating liblustreapi code to dump lmm containing EC information

2) Changes to add a new parity component to an existing layout

3) Changes to create a new layout containing parity components

4) Parity components are immutable so don't allow a component
   setting change with the flags

Parity components are always a specific setup, meaning we setup
individual OST objects. This is because we need to know which
components contain the data that we calculate the parity values
with.
