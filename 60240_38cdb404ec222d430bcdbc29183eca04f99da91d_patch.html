LU-14291 obdclass: unwind server code out of llog

Currently server internals are being pulled into llog. Break out
all the server code which limits the scope of the DT API. This
is done by moving all the server specific code to its own file.
This also brings us closer to the Linux native client. Difference
still exist that will be handled in a follow on patch to ensure
the Linux native clients differences don't break anything.
