LU-17240 tests: enable parallel unmounting across types

Enable inter-type parallelism for unmount operations, allowing
clients, MDTs, and OSTs to unmount simultaneously rather than
waiting for each type to complete sequentially.

WARNING: This feature is known to have stability issues and can
cause hangs during unmount. It is enabled here for testing
purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

Configuration:
- PARALLEL_UMOUNT_TYPES now inherits from PARALLEL_UMOUNT (=1)
- Allows client, MDT, and OST unmounts to overlap

Test environment:
- 1 MGS (combined with MDS)
- 1 MDT (245MB)
- 2 OSTs (391MB each)

Performance results (when it works):
- Baseline (sequential types): 24.6s
- With inter-type overlap: 11.9s
- Improvement: 51% faster (12.7s savings)

Known issues:
- Intermittent hangs during unmount operations
- Race conditions in cleanup ordering
- Resource deadlocks between target types
