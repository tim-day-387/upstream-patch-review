LU-18461 layout: join file implementation.

The "join file" feature in S3 is similar to the "merge" feature that was
available in previous versions of Lustre. This feature allows users to
combine multiple files into a single file, with the merged file being
placed at the end of the original files.

This functionality is useful for S3's multi-part upload process, as it
allows users to upload individual parts of a file (known as "chunks")
separately, and then merge them into a single, complete file without having
to copy the data multiple times. The "zero-offset" feature used in this
process allows each chunk to be stored as a separate, movable object, and
then merged together as components of the final file.
