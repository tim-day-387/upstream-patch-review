LU-19545 ec: tight binding parity mirror to data mirror

Parity mirrors need to be tightly coupled to the specific
data mirror they were created to match, so that we can
find the data mirror corresponding to the parity mirror.

To accomplish this, we stores the mirror ID of the data
mirror in each of the corresponding parity components.
