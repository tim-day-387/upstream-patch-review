LU-17515 lnet: adapt conns_per_peer using lustre_expected_clients

Use lustre_expected_clients as a hint to calculate the
conns_per_peer value to avoid creating excessive TCP
connections in large clusters.

The calculation derives candidate values based on link speed
(speed_cpp) and expected client count (expected_cpp), and selects
the most conservative conns_per_peer from speed_cpp and expected_cpp.
This keeps the total number of peer connections within safe limits
while allowing higher parallelism for smaller clusters.
