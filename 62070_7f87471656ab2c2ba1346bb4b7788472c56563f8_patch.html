LU-19531 mdd: limit mdd_is_parent() looping

Limit the number of iterations that mdd_is_parent() can loop when
trying to find if two FIDs are ancestors of each other.  In some
cases, it is possible for a thread to loop infinitely trying to
walk the tree to the parent FID.

Add debugging to try and identify where the problem is being hit,
whether it is in the cache only, or persistent on disk.
