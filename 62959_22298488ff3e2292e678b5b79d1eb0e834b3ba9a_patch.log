LU-19414 utils: lctl get_param --dshbak shows unique device names

When running 'lctl get_param --dshbak', if there are differences in
the contents of the parameters with the same name we could not tell
which device it came from as the --dshbak aggregates all devices.

Now the '*' will be used only if the content of all devices are the
same. Otherwise, the device numbers will be shown in a list format.

for example, if OST0000 and OST0001 have a different value than the
rest of the OSTs:
  ldlm.*.lustre-OST{0000,0001}-osc-MDT{0000}.dirty_age_limit=11
  ldlm.*.lustre-OST*-osc-MDT*.dirty_age_limit=10

Also modified the param diff highlighting to highlight per line
instead of for the entire parameter. This means that misaligned
table entries won't make the remainder of the parameter also red.
Another improvement was modifying the highlighting method to count
the matched/unmatched characters and then only print once when it
swaps states, instead of having a print call for each character.
