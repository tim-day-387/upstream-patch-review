LU-19631 lfs: Adjust EOF for ec parities in mirror read

LU-19631 llite: fix EOF issues with parity mirrors
removes the EOF hndling when reading from a mirror.
This has the effect that "lfs mirror read" will read
until 2**64-1 if the file was created with -1 as end
of mirror.

Add a check to adjust how much data we read in
"lfs mirror read" to be eof if we are reading from a
data mirror or adjust it so that it contains the full
parity stripes that covers the eof for data.
